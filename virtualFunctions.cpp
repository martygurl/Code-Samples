/*********************************************************************************************************************************************
 * Create three classes Person, Professor and Student. The class Person should have data members name and age. 
 * The classes Professor and Student should inherit from the class Person. 
 * The class Professor should have two integer members: publications and cur_id. There will be two member functions: getdata and putdata. 
 * The function getdata should get the input from the user: the name, age and publications of the professor. 
 * The function putdata should print the name, age, publications and the cur_id of the professor.
 * The class Student should have two data members: marks, which is an array of size 6 and cur_id. It has two member functions:
 * getdata and putdata. The function getdata should get the input from the user: the name, age, and the marks of the student in 6 subjects. 
 * The function putdata should print the name, age, sum of the marks and the cur_id of the student.
 * For each object being created of the Professor or the Student class, sequential id's should be assigned to them starting from 1.
 *  Solve this problem using virtual functions, constructors and static variables. 
 * 
 * Input format:
 * The first line of input contains the number of objects that are being created. If the first line of input for each object is 1, 
 * it means that the object being created is of the Professor class, you will have to input the name, age and publications of the professor.
 * If the first line of input for each object is 2, it means that the object is of the Student class, you will have to input the name, 
 * age and the marks of the student in 6 subjects.
 * 
 * Output format:
 * There are two types of output depending on the object.
 * If the object is of type Professor, print the space separated name, age, publications and id on a new line.
 * If the object is of the Student class, print the space separated name, age, the sum of the marks in  subjects and id on a new line.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= len(name) <= 100, where len(name) is the length of the name
 * 1 <= age <= 80
 * 1 <= publications <= 1000
 * 0 <= marks <= 100, where marks is the marks of the student in each subject
 * 
 * Example input:
 * 4
 * 1
 * Walter 56 99
 * 2
 * Jesse 18 50 48 97 76 34 98
 * 2
 * Pinkman 22 10 12 0 8 45 50
 * 1
 * White 58 87
 * 
 * Example Output:
 * Walter 56 99 1
 * Jesse 18 403 1
 * Pinkman 22 135 2
 * White 58 87 2
